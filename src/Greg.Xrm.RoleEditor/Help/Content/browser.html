	<h2>Role Browser</h2>
	<p>
		The role browser provides a visual representation of the roles in the system, organized within the Business Unit hierarchy 
		as modeled in your Dataverse environment. You can load the roles for the current environment 
		by clicking the "Load tables, privileges, and roles" button in the main window. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Roles will be <b>displayed in a tree</b> structure, where the <b>root node represents the organization</b>, 
		the <b>child nodes represent the business units</b>, and the <b>leaf nodes are the actual roles</b>.
		You can <b>change the XrmToolbox connection</b> while the tool is open and, by clicking the same button, 
		load the roles of the new environment, which will be displayed under a new root node. 
		This feature is particularly useful if you want to <em>compare roles between different environments</em>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Main Features</h3>
	<p>
		You can use the <em>Search</em> bar to filter roles by name. The search is <b>case-insensitive</b> 
		and will match any role containing the search term. 
		<br />
		By default, only customizable roles are displayed. You can show all roles by clicking on the 
		<em>Hide non-customizable roles</em> toggle menu.
		<br/>
		If you want to hide roles belonging to managed solutions, you can do so by clicking on the <em>Hide managed roles</em> toggle menu. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You can <b>expand</b> and <b>collapse</b> the nodes of the tree by clicking on the <b>plus</b> and <b>minus</b> icons.
		<br />
		<b>Double-clicking a role</b> will open the <a href="/editor">Role Editor</a> window, 
		where you can view and edit the role configuration (if the role is customizable).
	</p>

	<h3>Create New Roles</h3>
	<p>
		From the role browser, you can create new roles by clicking on the <em>Create new role</em> button. 
		This opens the <a href="/editor">Role Editor</a> window, where you can configure the new role.<br/>
		There are four ways to create a new role: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Start from an empty role</b>: This option creates a new role with no privileges or access levels. 
			If you have more than one environment loaded, the new role will be created in the environment 
			of the currently selected role. If no role is selected, the first environment in the list is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Clone selected role</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels 
			as the selected role. The new role will be created in the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>From "Basic User"</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels 
			as the "Basic User" role (if present in the selected environment). The new role will be created in 
			the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>From "App Opener"</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels
			as the "App Opener" role (if present in the selected environment). The new role will be created in 
			the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
	</ul>
