	<h2>Create a new role</h2>
	<p>
		From the role browser, you can create new roles by clicking on the <em>Create new role</em> button.
		This opens the <a href="/editor">Role Editor</a> window, where you can configure the new role.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tool provides 4 different ways to create a new role:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Start from an empty role</b>: This option creates a new role with no privileges or access levels.
			If you have more than one environment loaded, the new role will be created in the environment
			of the currently selected role. If no role is selected, the first environment in the list is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Clone selected role</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels
			as the selected role. The new role will be created in the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>From "Basic User"</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels
			as the "Basic User" role (if present in the selected environment). The new role will be created in
			the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>From "App Opener"</b>: This option creates a new role with the same privileges and access levels
			as the "App Opener" role (if present in the selected environment). The new role will be created in
			the environment of the currently selected role.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Once selected the creation method, a new <a href="/browser">Role Browser</a> window will spawn,
		set onto the <b>General information</b> tab where you can specify the <b>name</b>, <b>description</b>,
		parent <b>Business Unit</b> and <b>member's privilege inheritance</b> of the new role.
	</p>
	<p>
		All info except description are required to save the role.
	</p>
