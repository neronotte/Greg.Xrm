	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>
		<b>_n.EnvironmentComparer</b> allows to compare data between two distinct environments.<br />
		His main purpose is to simplify the migration of <b>configuration data</b> during the deployment process,
		providing a <b>winmerge like</b> UI.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Please note:</b> this tool is not suitable to compare large amount of data. <br />
		If you need to compare large amount of data we suggest to apply different approaches such as copying data to 
		staging tables on Azure SQL and apply comparison via Stored Procedures.
	</p>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Connect to the first environment (ENV1).</li>
		<li>Connect to a second environment (ENV2).</li>
		<li><a href="/configurator">Create (or open) a comparison map, deciding which tables/columns to compare and which rules to apply.</a></li>
		<li><a href="/configurator">Execute the comparison</a> and <a href="/result-grid">analyze results</a>.</li>
		<li>Track and apply <a href="/configurator">actions</a> on (copy record from ENV1 to ENV2 or vice-versa).</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Connect to an environment</h3>
	<p>
		The plugin toolbar highlights the environments that will be used on the comparison.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If not connectect at startup, you can use XrmToolBox connection control
			to open the connection dialog and select the environment. The selected environment will be shown
			in the plugin toolbar, replacing the label <b>1. Connect to environment 1</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once connected to the first environment, you can use the toolbar button <b>2. Connect to environment 2</b>
			to open the connection dialog and select the second environment.<br />
			To change connection you can click again on the same button. A prompt will ask for confirmation before removing the current connection.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Please note:</b> changing one of the connections will reset the plugin context, removing any previously executed result.
